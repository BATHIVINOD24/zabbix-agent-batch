# zabbix-agent-batch
This is the script I have written to do a bunch of auto stuff. So instead of doing a several step process to install the Zabbix Agent on Windows hosts, then applying the config settings, and starting the services, and configuring the windows firewall, this script does it all for me in about a second now.
